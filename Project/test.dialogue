Phist: [[Hi|Hello|Dia duit]], it is dark. I know I must do this every year, but it’s still kind of creepy... oh... I think I hear someone. [#mood=calm]

Balor: Who goes there... and what do you want?[#npcmood=calm]

Phist: Dia duit, Phist is ainm dom. I am making my way to the surface — can you help me? Más é do thoil é. [#mood=happy]

Balor: The surface... you are a long way from there.[#npcmood=stern]

Phist: Yes, it is a long journey. Can you help me get to the next layer?[#mood=stern]

Balor: I can help, but first you must do something for me.  [#npcmood=calm]
I have lost something important — my *scian*.  
If you can find this and bring it to me, I will help you get to the next layer.  
Will you accept this quest?[#npcmood=blush]

As you fulfilled your side, I will fulfil mine.[#npcmood=shock]

Phist: So, will you help me get to the next layer? [#mood=happy]

Tell my old friend *“bhí sé ina chara maith agam”* and they will help.  
Ádh mór agus slán leat.
